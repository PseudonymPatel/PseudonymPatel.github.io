<p style="font-style:italic;">Hi. In this blog post, I discuss a type of YouTube content that is extremely detrimental to children. I go into depth on why this content is so effective, and then talk about some possible solutions. DISCLAIMER: I am not a writer, so bear with me. If no one talks about problems because they aren’t good at talking, the world would move at a snail’s pace.

	<p style="color: lightgrey;">With the popularization of YouTube, along came a bunch of people who decided to milk it for money. They created content that has no value and loaded it with filler and advertisements in order to make the most money per video, with the least amount of effort spent on the videos. They almost exclusively target young children with a variety of different tactics that exploit the children for views, wasting the child’s time in the process. Just like how you told your grandma that the free iPhone giveaways are a scam, parents and siblings can tell the young children in their life that these types of videos are garbage.

<p>There’s a problem with children’s entertainment that’s slowly crept up on us, and the majority are none the wiser. There is a growing group of people whose entire venture it is to turn children’s time into money. I call this exploitative entertainment. It is entertainment that has no educational or entertainment benefit, riddled with advertisements, and its entire reason for being is to make kids watch enough of it so the creator can make their revenue. The creator essentially exploits children under the guise of “entertainment.” This is a problem steadily growing, but one that can be stopped simply by educating people.</p>
<p>But before we talk in depth about the content itself, we need to understand the fundamental things that led to it. The internet and greed. The internet itself is not inherently bad; I’d argue that it is one of the greatest, if not <em>the greatest</em> invention of the modern world. It allows people to connect, services to be bought and sold, and entire companies to flourish. It also allows people to reach millions of others for little or even no money. And when this is exploited, it leads to disastrous consequences. Creators on YouTube, for example, can make whatever content they want, and, provided they get enough views, can turn hours watched into cold, hard cash. Through advertisements placed on the ends and throughout the video, people who view the video for free generate income for the creator, who didn’t have to pay a dime to publish their video. As long as the content stays within the lax community guidelines, a creator is free to publish whatever they like. The majority of YouTubers (also known as content creators) create entertaining, informative, or otherwise interesting content. Many use it to share creations or things in their lives. However, some exploit these lax guidelines.</p>

<h2>The Content Itself</h2>
<p>These exploiters make content that is engineered to be clicked on. Adults are all too familiar with “clickbait” on websites, where they entice you with free iPhone giveaways and “this quiz will predict your favorite sport” quizzes only to lead you to a page chock full of ads and endless surveys. These exploitative videos are much the same. They are almost always targeted at young children -- simply because they are the least likely to know better and click away. First of all, the titles and the thumbnail -- the first thing you see about a video -- are designed to grab your attention. “DO NOT FACETIME MICKEY MOUSE AT 3AM!! *OMG HE CAME TO MY HOUSE*” is a great example of one of these titles. The thumbnail features the creator with an extremely surprised look with his phone “facetiming” Mickey Mouse. Although it makes no sense to anyone with any real-world experience, young children are particularly vulnerable to this.
</p>
<p>The fact that only young children are vulnerable to this presents another problem. The YouTube algorithm, as well as other algorithms on other platforms, feed content that is similar to the content that one has already watched. This means that adults and people who recognize it for what it is skip it, and the people who watch it get recommended more of it. The content requires almost no effort to make. The video title mentioned above uses the same footage and essentially the same script as a video from three <em>years</em> ago. He is still doing the same fake giveaway, the same fidget spinner intro, the same video ending sequence. Children, once they watch a single video, are bombarded with more of the same exact formula.
</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the creators make the video exactly long enough to add mid-roll ads, or ads that will interrupt the video. YouTube mandates that a video must be at least eight minutes long (down from the 10 minutes it was at for many years) for a creator to put these mid-roll ads. These videos are right at the minimum. Their content is content that should fit maybe a 30 second skit, but it is pumped up and stretched out to fit the eight or ten minutes that is required. What do they put in the middle to stretch it out? Garbage. Repeating the same thing phrased differently. Calls to buy their merchandise. Pointless and repetitive content. They are maximising the amount of money they can make with the least effort possible.
</p>
<p>These exploiters make many calls to action for the viewers to subscribe to their channel, like the video, and be notified for future videos in order to grow their viewership. Getting people to subscribe and interact with a channel is proven to be the number one most effective way to grow a channel and get more views. The Mickey Mouse video referenced above does this as the first thing a viewer sees when they open a video. It goes something like this: “If I can do [some small challenge] for 5 seconds, you have to subscribe. Deal?” followed by him completing the challenge with zero effort and some obviously fake excitement. He then launches a lengthy sequence with a subscription and liking animation and proceeds to talk about a fake giveaway. This man attempts to guilt small children into subscribing (which is free) by striking up a “deal” with them to make it seem more fair. He uses language like, “you have to” and “must” in order to be more commanding. Using commands in this way is a common psychological technique used by advertisers in order to improve the success of their ads. This one channel is not the only one to do it, either.
</p>
<p>There are hundreds of channels that use gimmicky and exploitative behaviors in order to generate hours of watchtime. They are quite literally exploiting children for monetary profit. The channel mentioned throughout the video (deliberately avoiding the name) has over 2.5 <em>million</em> subscribers, and gains hundreds of thousands of hours of watchtime on their videos.
</p>
<p>There is one final piece of the puzzle that holds everything together: the high energy presentation of the content. The main thing that keeps children hooked and interested in the content is the way the creator talks, moves, and edits. The creator always shouts and uses exaggerated facial expressions and body language. They are generally very loud, even when “whispering” or being stealthy. The creator and anyone else in the video are generally noisy and attention-seeking. Children are attracted to the stimulus of the creator’s energy and the creator exploits this by shouting their messages and getting a child’s attention.
</p>

<h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
<p>YouTube itself does nothing to stop this. They are a corporation after all, and they stand to gain from this, too. They gain a section of the ad revenue and they grow their platform. This means that to make a difference, we, the viewers, the parents, the kids, need to stand up and spread the word. We need to teach parents the problem, so they can teach their kid.
</p>
<p>If all the parents took 5 minutes to talk to their kid about what they watch properly, we could both save children’s time and discourage the exploiters. First, I want to emphasise that content creation and the free internet are some of the most beneficial things in the world, used correctly. Children are smarter than we give them credit for. I believe that if children are simply educated about what this type of content is, and how to avoid it, then we can solve a lot of the problem. Once children are aware of how this content is, and how it works, then they will recognize it in what they watch, and will not want to watch that content anymore. They just need to be aware of how harmful it is.
