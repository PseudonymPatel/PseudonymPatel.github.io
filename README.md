# pseudonympatel.github.io AKA sheenpatel.com
Hi! This is the repository for the sheenpatel.com website, meaning that it hosts all the code, so, you can run it yourself!
The website itself is unfinished, due to having to do college applications. 

If you are having any problems with it, please create a github issue. If you are using IE, don't. If you don't have js enabled, you are missing out.
No eta. It's only me and I got better stuff to do (college apps lmao)

## To Run It (Installation)
Simply download/clone this repo, and since it is a website, you can simply just open `index.html` in your browser. As long as you have javascript enabled, it will work.
