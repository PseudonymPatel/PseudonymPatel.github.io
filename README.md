# pseudonympatel.github.io AKA sheenpatel.com
Hi! This is the repository for the sheenpatel.com website, meaning that it hosts all the code, so, you can run it yourself!
The website itself is unfinished, due to having to do college applications. No eta. It's only me and I got better stuff to do (college apps lmao)

## To Run It (Installation)
Simply download/clone this repo, and since it is a webiste, you can simply just open `index.html` in your browser.
