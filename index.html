			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<div class="content"><p>
				Please note: This website was originally built to show my computer science projects and has
				little to do with my current engineering (student) career! I hope to start incorporating new things to
				the site, but for now, this website is still going to be mainly computer-oriented.
				<br /><br />
				Making things is in my blood. I'm interested in trying new technologies and pushing old ones to
				the breaking point. In my spare time, I've been developing and exploring flight simulators and
				have recently built a throttle and joystick system for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (check out the <a href="blog/nxtthrottle.html">blog post here</a>).
				I've done the same with a Wii remote, and it's surprisingly fun!
				<br /></br />
				A couple (many) months ago I experimented with
				<a href="https://medium.com/@icyphox/what-are-ctfs-and-why-you-should-care-652f44b18221">CTFs</a>
				and expanded my low level computing knowledge. I've started on my own operating system,
				which I have no time to actually work on!
				<br /><br />
				At this point, I'm now in university! I haven't really touched this site in a couple months,
				mostly due to university, but I hope to change that. I've started on a lot of big projects and
				it's honestly fine if you don't even know about them because it's not like you care. Honestly,
				who even is looking at this site, probably a friend who Googled my name and this is the first
				result so <i>I guess</i> you want to see what I'm doing so here you go this is the site I made
				in high school so I could be in the first page of Google and also have a blog where I can ramble
				about various topics.
				<br /><br />
				If you want to see some of my stuff, why don't you check out my <a href="https:github.com/PseudonymPatel">GitHub</a> or my <a href="blog">blog</a>!

			<h3>What I Do (or used to do, in high school, haven't updated this yet)</h3>
			<div class="content">
				<h4>I've dabbled in a bit of everything, and I'm still exploring! (Yea, mostly concrete now)</h4>
				<h5>You'll find me frequenting</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Swift (now experimenting with windows libraries!)</li>
					<li>The unix command line (zsh ftw)</li>
					<li>Python (aka runnable pseudocode)</li>
					<li>Machine Learning (haha math go minima)</li>
					<li>neovim (vimrc on <a href="https://github.com/PseudonymPatel/neovimSetup">github</a>!)</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>I also love to teach!</h4>
				<p>
					I have learned almost all of my programming and computer science knowledge from teaching myself,
					and I want to pay back my knowledge and lead kids to find their STEM passions!
